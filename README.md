Android-Hello-World
===================

## Notes

* This application is locked in landscape orientation. Understandably, many device screens will not like the layout. Feel free to tinker around with the view in res/layout/activity_main.xml
* You may need to create a new token/session to connect. See http://dashboard.tokbox.com/projects
* See the javadocs at docs/ in this repo.
* AVD/emulator will not work at this time.
* The SDK generates quite a bit of logging. Every logging tag starts with "opentok-", so you can easily filter while debugging.
